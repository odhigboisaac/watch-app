1. Python and How to create Monitoring Application in Python using Flask and psutil
2. How to run a Python App locally.
3. Learn Docker and How to containerize a Python application
    1. Creating Dockerfile
    2. Building DockerImage
    3. Running Docker Container
    4. Docker Commands
4. Create public repository using dockerhub and pushing Docker Image to the repository.
5. Create Kubernetes Deployments and Services.



## **Prerequisites** !

(Things to have before starting the projects)
- [x]  Python3 Installed.
- [x]  Docker and Kubectl installed.
- [x]  Code editor (Vscode)

# âœ¨Letâ€™s Start the Project âœ¨

## **Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally**

### **Step 1: Clone the code**

Clone the code from the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

### **Step 2: Install dependencies**

The application uses the **`psutil`** and **`Flask`, Plotly,** libraries. Install them using pip:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Run the application**

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```
python3 app.py
```

This will start the Flask server on **`localhost:5000`**. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) on your browser to access the application.

## **Part 2: Dockerizing the Flask application**

### **Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**

Create a **`Dockerfile`** in the root directory of the project with the following contents:

```
# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Set the environment variables for the Flask app
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the Flask app when the container is run
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

### **Next-Step : Build the Docker image and push to dockerhub will be defined on the jenkinsfile.**

### **Next-Step : create kubernetes deployment and services.**
